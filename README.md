# r2_experiment

The goal of this exercise is to get a better understanding of the definition of r2. 
Everybody knows that it is of the most frequently used loss functions for regressions. 
Often people say that it takes values between 0 and 1, which is actually not true. 
I want to show the importance to understand what happens when r2 is zero. 
If one has understand this, than it is easier to image/understand what is happening when r2 is > 0 and < 0. 
All this is done without training a model, as all that is needed can be done using generated data.
