# r2_experiment

The goal of this exercise is to get a better understanding of the definition of r2. It is one of the most common loss functions for regressions. It is often assumed to take values between 0 and 1, which is actually not true. I want to show the importance to understand what happens when r2 is zero. If one has understand this, than it is easier to image/understand what is happening when r2 is > 0 and < 0. All this is done without training a model, as all that is needed can be done using generated data.
